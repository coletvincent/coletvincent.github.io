#### What is this website?
---
I am intending this website to be a basis for my professional and academic endeavors. I have a second website, which you can find more details about on my "about" page. This github website will reflect what is going on in the classroom and beyond that, such as research. I will update this website as my life updates.

#### Contact

As of right now, I am not listing any contact information, as I do not think it is important. There is currently nothing of interest on this website and therefore no reason for contact information to be shared.
